# Tidal player for Sailfish OS

This might be one day a Tidal Player for Sailfish OS using the tidalapi v0.7.1 (https://tidalapi.netlify.app/). 

### TIDAL API useage
As v0.7.1 is not fully compatible with TIDAL anymore, the line 114 of tidalapi/user.py is removed during the packaging process.

### Usage of AI
The current development is driven by Claude 3.5 Sonnet. The icon is made by Midjourney.
